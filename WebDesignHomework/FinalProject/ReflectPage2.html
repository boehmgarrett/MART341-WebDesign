    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Tools & Frameworks</h1>
    <p>The tools that I have used for my projects this semester are GitHub, and Visual Studio Code.</p>

    <img src="Images/GitHub.png" alt="GitHub" style="width: 50%">

    <p>I used GitHub by putting all of my assignments into my documents and in my GitHub folder, and then I pushed all of the parts of each assignment to the GitHub Website with the GitHub Desktop.</p>

    <img src="Images/Visual Studio Code.png" alt="VSC" style="width: 50%">

    <p>I used Visual Studio Code to help make all of my assignments by inserting the contents such as pictures, soundtracks, and design the styles for each assignment.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Creative Thinking Process</h1>

    <img src="Images/Grand Finale.jpg" alt="Final" style="width: 50%">

    <p>I've applied design principles by makeing sure there are not a lot of random colors, or mixed up content in my website, makeing sure everything is in a good place and make sure to leave room for more content soon to be added to the website. These principles helped improve my designs by making the contents more understandble, more organized, more eye-catching, and easier to locate in the website.</p>

    <p>My best ideas sparked when I watch different types of TV shows or movies, play certain video games, read certain books or other fanfiction sites, and even listening to certain types of music that I find very amazing. When I see or hear different types of entertainment I sometimes get them stuck in my head that make myself think, "What could I do to change, or improve on this?" Now that I have learned more about Web Design, I am free to share some of my ideas to others, and let them share their ideas too.</p>
