    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Growth</h1>
    <img src="Images/Soundtrack.jpg" alt="Soundtrack" style="width: 50%">
    <p>The skills that I improved on the most are the planning for what the website should contain and what it should look like, the size for each content that is included in the website, and importing content into my website such as images, videos, and even some soundtracks.</p>
    <p>The transferable skills that I have developed throughout the course in the semester is inputing media into my website, before I took this class I knew how to insert images into my websites, however I do not think that I have ever found a way to put any soundtracks on a website, but now I do. Now with this website, people can insert the soundtracks they have made for their ideas for certain franchises they have created.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Web Presence</h1>
    <img src="Images/Meatball Sub Site.jpg" alt="Instruction Site" style="width: 50%">
    <p>I have improved a website by putting in some eyecatching pictures and seperate categories with some contents of which are related or are close enough to be the same. The websites that I really improved on are my Fanfiction website, and my How to Make You Own Meatball Sub at Home website.</p>
    <p>The strategies that really helped with the Web Design process are the project planning, changing the colors for a containing box, and for the background of the website, and to separate different contents from each other, such as different franchises for entertainment. Project planning really helped me decide what include in my website and how and where to place it. Changing the colors helps the viewers figure out where they want to look if they are looking for something specific, and it'll help make the words easier to read. And separating different will make it eaier to balance the website rather than just cram everything together in one place.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Technical Skills</h1>
    <img src="Images/Organized.jpg" alt="Fanfic Site" style="width: 50%">
    <p>Most of my projects have HTML tags like div classes, to keep the contents of my websites organized, neat, and balanced throughout the whole page. I used CSS to store most of my style for my websites such as the word fonts, the borders within the websites, and the background color for the website. For the responsive techniques I for the selecting process and the detail process and my making a story page of my website for the viewers to enter whatever they want in it.</p>
