<p>My name is Garrett Boehm, and I'm taking game design classes in college. I am attending school in Missoula, Montana. I try to do my best and not leave work at the last minute.</p>
<p>I started with a two year degree, but them I realized that I would want to slow down a little before going into the real world. I am supported by Vocational Rehab because or my autism disability. I also get some help in TRIO.</p>
