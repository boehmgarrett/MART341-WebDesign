One of the three website ideas I've chosen to develop further is the Fanfiction Website. I chose to further develop the Fanfiction Website because the sooner I can create this website the sooner I can put up my ideas for people to see.

Adjusting the background color of the page really helped make the pages more attractive, and adjusting the width of the pictures really helped fill in the space.

Along the way of making my final design I wanted the page to be more attractive, so I made the words have color, but I made the background darker so the words would be much easier to read. I also made the picture the right size so that it'll fill more space, and to keep the viewer interested.

The challenges I've faced during this assignment are figuring out exactly what to do, and how to do them. I overcame these challenges by see the example posted on Canvas, researching on Google, and looking back on the course website.

So far in this class I am doing just fine. With the instructions on the course website, I am learning how to do these assignments. I will let you know if I need any help later on in the semester.
