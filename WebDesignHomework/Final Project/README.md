Your Growth:

The skills that I improved on the most are the planning for what the website should contain and what it should look like, the size for each content that is included in the website, and importing content into my website such as images, videos, and even some soundtracks.

The transferable skills that I have developed throughout the course in the semester is inputing media into my website, before I took this class I knew how to insert images into my websites, however I do not think that I have ever found a way to put any soundtracks on a website, but now I do. Now with this website, people can insert the soundtracks they have made for their ideas for certain franchises they have created.

Web Presence:

I have improved a website by putting in some eyecatching pictures and seperate categories with some contents of which are related or are close enough to be the same. The websites that I really improved on are my Fanfiction website, and my How to Make You Own Meatball Sub at Home website.

The strategies that really helped with the Web Design process are the project planning, changing the colors for a containing box, and for the background of the website, and to separate different contents from each other, such as different franchises for entertainment. Project planning really helped me decide what include in my website and how and where to place it. Changing the colors helps the viewers figure out where they want to look if they are looking for something specific, and it'll help make the words easier to read. And separating different will make it eaier to balance the website rather than just cram everything together in one place.

Technical Skills:

Most of my projects have HTML tags like div classes, to keep the contents of my websites organized, neat, and balanced throughout the whole page. I used CSS to store most of my style for my websites such as the word fonts, the borders within the websites, and the background color for the website. For the responsive techniques I for the selecting process and the detail process and my making a story page of my website for the viewers to enter whatever they want in it.

Tools & Frameworks:

The tools that I have used for my projects this semester are GitHub, and Visual Studio Code.

I used GitHub by putting all of my assignments into my documents and in my GitHub folder, and then I pushed all of the parts of each assignment to the GitHub Website with the GitHub Desktop.

I used Visual Studio Code to help make all of my assignments by inserting the contents such as pictures, soundtracks, and design the styles for each assignment.

Creative Thinking:

I've applied design principles by makeing sure there are not a lot of random colors, or mixed up content in my website, makeing sure everything is in a good place and make sure to leave room for more content soon to be added to the website. These principles helped improve my designs by making the contents more understandble, more organized, more eye-catching, and easier to locate in the website.

My best ideas sparked when I watch different types of TV shows or movies, play certain video games, read certain books or other fanfiction sites, and even listening to certain types of music that I find very amazing. When I see or hear different types of entertainment I sometimes get them stuck in my head that make myself think, "What could I do to change, or improve on this?" Now that I have learned more about Web Design, I am free to share some of my ideas to others, and let them share their ideas too.
