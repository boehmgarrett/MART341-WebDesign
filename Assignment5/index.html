<h1>Garrett Boehm Website Ideas</h1>

<hr />

<h3>Fanfiction Website</h3>
    <p>One of my website ideas is a Fanfiction website. I can put in all of my ideas for TV shows, video games, and movies. I would like to use a balanced tone that'll fit everyone's imagination perfectly.</p>

<h3>"What If" Website</h3>
    <p>The second website I would create is a "What If" Website. I can put down different ideas for TV shows and movies as if I were the maker of these enterataining pieces. I would like a random tone of color, because I can put down any random idea in this website.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Video Games Website</h3>
    <p>The final website is a video game website. I can put down the plots and details of any video game in existance, even video that I made up on my own. I would want a cyber-tone of color, because some video games are a part of cyber space which includes the internet.</p>
